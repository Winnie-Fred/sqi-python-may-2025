# ASSIGNMENT CORRECTION
# 1. Collect two numbers as input from the user and assign as variables, a and b, write an if 
# statement that prints "a and b are both positive" if both a and b are positive, prints 
# "Only one is positive" if one of them is positive, and prints "Neither is positive" if 
# neither is positive.
# 2. Collect three numbers x, y and z as a comma separated string input from the user and print "Increasing order" if they are in STRICTLY increasing order, "Decreasing order" if they are in STRICTLY decreasing order, and "Neither" otherwise.
# Write a program that reads a string called `palindrome` supplied through user input and checks if it is a palindrome. Print "Is a palindrome" if it is, otherwise print "Not a palindrome".
# 4. You have three variables: x, y, and z collected as 3 separate inputs from the user. Write an if statement that checks if exactly two out of the three variables are equal and prints "Two are equal" if this is true. Otherwise, print "All different" or "All same" accordingly.
# x = input("Enter the value of x: ").strip()

# else:

# 5. Given three angles angle1, angle2, and angle3 collected as 3 separate inputs from the user, use if statements to check if they can form a valid triangle. Print "Valid triangle" if the sum of the angles is 180 degrees and all angles are greater than 0. Otherwise, print "Invalid triangle".

# else:

# 6. You have a single character variable `ch` supplied through user input. Write an if statement that prints "Vowel" if ch is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, both uppercase and lowercase), and "Consonant" otherwise. 

# ch = input("Enter a single alphabetic character: ").strip().lower()

# 7. Given a comma separated string input from the user of three colors color1, color2, and color3, write an if statement to check if all three colors are primary colors (red, blue, yellow). Print "All primary colors" if they are, otherwise print "Not all primary colors".

# 8. You have a variable `mode` supplied by the user which can be "manual", "automatic", or "off". Write an if statement that prints "Manual mode activated" if mode is "manual", "Automatic mode activated" if mode is "automatic", and "System is off" if mode is "off".

# message = input("Enter a message: ").lower()

# if "urgent" in message or "immediate" in message or "important" in message:

# 10.	You have two variables, status1 and status2, provided through user input, each of 
# which can be "active", â€œinactive", or "pending". Write an if statement to print 
# "Both active" if both statuses are "active", "One active" if exactly one is "active",
# and "None active" if neither is "active".
# 11. 	Given a string `filename` supplied by the user, write an if statement to check if the

# 15. Write a program that takes three numbers (num1, num2, num3) as a comma-separated string 
# input from the user and prints the greatest number. Use conditional statements

# statements.
